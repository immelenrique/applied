Likewise, I enjoy many ammenities in the neighborhood , such as international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment.\nI have been offered a great opportunity to work in Manhattan, NY. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stress toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Manhattan. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during the Coursera course to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding.\nOf course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it rewarding doing it myself with learned tools.\n\n\n    "

Therefore, in order to set a basis for comparison, I want to find a renta unit subject to the following conditions: \n- Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$7000/month\n- Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan\n- Area with ammenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location ( See item 2.1)\n\n### 1.3 Interested Audience\nI believe this is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to a major city in Europe, US or Asia, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills.\n"

A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. The csv file 'mh_neigh_data.csv'  has the following below data structure. The file will be directly read to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and space savings. The clustering of neighborhoods and mapping will be shown however. An algorythm was used to determine the geodata from Nominatim .

The csv file \"nnnn.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorythm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim() , it was possible to determine the latitude and longiude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorythms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0\n\"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius.\nFoursquare is used to find the avenues at Manhattan neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending of the location shown.\n\n### 2.4 How the data will be used to solve the problem\nThe data will be used as follows:\nUse Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)\nUse foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately\nUse Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.\ncreate a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\nAddresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\nData will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n\n### 2.5 Mapping of Data\nThe following maps were created to facilitate the analysis and the choice of the palace to live.\nManhattan map of Neighborhoods\nmanhattan subway metro locations\nManhattan map of places for rent\nManhattan map of clustered venues and neighborhoods\nCombined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations\nCombined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations and venues clusters"

This visual approach and maps with popups labels allow quick identification of  location, price and feature, thus  making the selection very easy. \n\nThe procesing of these DATA and its mapping will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n- what is the cost of available rental places that meet the demands?\n- what is the cost of rent around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n- what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future rental home?\n- What are the venues of the two best places to live?

Apt 1 is located 400 meters from subway station at 59th Street and work place ( Park Ave and 53rd) is another 600 meters way. I can walk to work place and use subway for other places aroung. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 2 and it is located in a fine district in the East side of Manhattan.\n\n### Apartment 2 rent cost is US6935, just under the US7000 budget. Apt 2 is located 60 meters from subway station at Fulton Street, but I will have to ride the subway daily to work , possibly 40-60 min ride. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 3.\u00b6\n\n## Based on current Singapore venues, I feel that Cluster 2 type of venues is a closer resemblance to my current place. That means that APARTMENT 1 is a better choice since the extra monthly rent is worth the conveniences it provides."
